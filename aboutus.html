          <p>That is because to us, chocolate is more than an exquisite treat. It is also a way to connect, a gift, a salve. It is one of life fabulous little pleasures.</br></br>

          We have been using honest ingredients to create premium chocolate that satisfies the cravings and passions of discerning chocolate lovers. And now we are proud to be part of a larger movement to produce distinctive, memorable products from right here in the Pacific Northwest. A taste of Seattle Chocolates is like a sunny day in March with Mt. Rainier glowing in the distance. Like a bounty of summer fruit from the farmers market. Like a cozy evening in front of the fireplace while the rain trickles down the windows. Like an afternoon on the Ferry taking an adventure. The combination of local flavors and inspired design makes Seattle Chocolates irrefutably yours.</br></br>

          Our small and mighty company is owned by Mr. Bertha, a seasoned and self-taught chocolatier. Our entire chocolate line is certified Kosher, and many varieties are also gluten-free and vegan. We have a deep commitment to giving back to our roots, while also supporting and donating to organizations that better the lives of American families, specifically those groups dedicated to abolishing hunger here in the U.S. In 2012, we created the Milk brand with a focus on feeding hungry families, at its core. For each Milk bar sold, we donate a serving of fresh healthy food to one of our four food bank partners. You can learn more about our philanthropic efforts and giving mission here. </p>
